\section*{Acknowledgements}

The authors would like to thank Gunther Weber and Mark Howison at
LBNL for productive discussions, as well as Sean Ahern at ORNL for
numerous discussions on `decoupled' processing and rendering, which we
unfortunately did not have time to consider in depth for this work.

Some computations described in this work were performed using the
\href{http://enzo-project.org}{Enzo code}, which is the product of a
collaborative effort of scientists at many universities and national
laboratories.  We especially thank Matthew Turk and Sam Skillman for
their help interfacing with \texttt{yt}.  We thank Burlen Loring for
help with ParaView scripting.
