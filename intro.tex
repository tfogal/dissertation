* vis is important

* performance is critical

* interesting time for this:
	* GPUs
	* versus CPU threads
	* versus Phi?
	* future architecture of supercomputers defined by current research
	* programmability
	* CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP, OpenAcc

* volume rendering
	* definition
	* why is it used
	* imagevis3d (not tuvok!)

* in situ visualization
	* solves
		* data too large to be read
		* end-to-end 'time-to-insight' performance
	* problems
		* how metadata is transferred
		* vis cannot slow down sim (much)
		* data access from sim -> vis
		* difficulty in coupling sim+vis
		* how often do we update vis
		* \emph{when} do we update vis

* parallel io
	* filesystems
	* lustre
	* MDSs, ODSs or whatever they're called
	* DDoS metadata
	* false sharing

* prevalence of regular grids
